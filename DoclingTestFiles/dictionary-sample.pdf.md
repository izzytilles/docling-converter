## A Brief History of English Usage

English  usage  today  is  an  area of  discourse-sometimes it seems  more like dispute-about the way words are used and ought to be used. This discourse makes up the  subject matter of a large number of books  that put the word usage in their titles. Behind usage as a subject lies  a collection  of  opinions  about  what  English grammar is or should be, about the propriety of using certain words and phrases, and about the social status of those who use certain words and constructions. A fairly large number  of  these  opinions have  been  with  us  long enough to be regarded as rules or at least to be referred to  as  rules.  In  fact  they  are often  regarded  as  rules  of grammar,  even  if  they  concern  only  matters  of  social status or vocabulary selection.  And many of these rules are widely believed  to have universal application, even though they are far from universally observed.

the  doubters  sought  to  put  flesh  on  the  bare bones  of English  by  importing  words  from  Latin,  Italian,  and French-the European languages of learned and graceful discourse.  Among  those who enriched English from the word stock of Europe were Sir Thomas Elyot and Sir Thomas  More. Opposed to  these enrichers of  the  language were purists such as Roger Ascham and Sir John Cheke,  who preferred their English, rude as it might be, untainted  by  foreign  imports.  The  imported  learned terms  became  known  as inkhorn terms, and  their  use and misuse by the imperfectly educated became the subject of much lively satire-some of it written by Shakespeare, among many others.

To  understand  how  these opinions  and  rules  developed, we have to go back in history, at least as far back as  the  year  1417,  when  the  official  correspondence  of Henry  V  suddenly  and  almost  entirely  stopped  being written in  French and started being  written in English. By mid-century many government documents and even private  letters  were  in  English,  and  before 1500  even statutes were being recorded in the mother tongue.  This restoration of English as the official language of the royal bureaucracy  was  one  very  important  influence  on  the gradual emergence of a single standard dialect of English out  of  the  many  varied  regional  dialects  that  already existed.  English now had to serve the functions formerly served by Latin  and French,  languages which had already  assumed  standard forms,  and  this  new  reality was a powerful  spur to  the  formation  of  a standard in writing English that could be quite independent of variable  speech.  The  process  was certainly not  completed within  the 15th century,  but  increasingly  the  written form of the language that modern scholars call Chancery English had its effect,  in  combination  with  other  influences  such  as the  newfangled  process  of  printing from movable type.

But the rise of Standard English did not by itself generate concern over usage. There was no special  interest in language as such at that time. Indeed, the English historian G. M. Trevelyan called the  15th century, until its last fifteen or twenty  years, the  most  intellectually barren  epoch  in  English  history  since  the  Norman  conquest.  Not  until  Henry  VII had established  himself  on the throne near the end  of the century did  the  intellectual  ferment  of  the  European  Renaissance  begin  to  be felt  in  England.  By the  middle  of  the  16th century  the English Renaissance was in full flower, and the revival of learning and letters brought with it a conscious interest  in  the  English  language  as  a  medium  for literature and learned discourse. There were those who had their doubts  about  its  suitability.  Still,  the  desire  to  use  the vernacular rather than  Latin was  strong,  and  some  of

In  addition  to  the  controversy  over  imported  words there were other concerns,  such  as the  state  of English spelling.  In those days people mostly  spelled  things  the way  they sounded, and  there  was  little uniformity indeed. A number of people consequently became interested in  spelling  reform.  Among  these was the  schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster, who may have served as the model  for Shakespeare's  pedant  Holofernes.  Mulcaster and the somewhat  later Edmund Coote were  interested in  regularizing spelling  as best  they  could.  There  were more  radical  reformers,  too-John  Hart,  Sir  Thomas Smith, and William Bullokar are examples-who devised  phonetic  alphabets  to  better  represent  English speech  sounds.  Bullokar is  worthy  of  note for  another reason: in 1586 he published Bref Grammar for English -the first English grammar book.  It was probably  intended  as  an  introduction  to  the subsequent study of Latin grammar.

So  16th-century interest in language produced two  of the  basic  tools of the  writer on  usage.  Bullokar, out  of his  interest  in  regularizing  and  reforming,  had  been moved  to write a grammar of English. And  the  vocabulary  controversy-the  introduction  of  inkhorn  terms by the enrichers and the revival of English archaisms by the  purists  (of  whom  the  poet  Edmund  Spenser  was one)-led  another  schoolmaster,  Robert  Cawdrey,  to produce the first English dictionary in  1604.

The  17th century provides several more signposts  on the way to the treatment of usage as we know it. One  of these is the  expression  of a desire  for regulation  of  the language by an academy similar to the ones  established in Italy in the  16th century and in France in  1635. Calls for  the  establishment  of  an  English  academy  came  as early as  1617; among the writers to urge one were John Dryden in 1664, John Evelyn in  1665, and Daniel Defoe in 1697.

More  grammar books  were  also  published  at  this time.  Ben Jonson's appeared posthumously  in  1640. It is  short and  sketchy  and is intended for the  use  of foreigners. Its grammar is descriptive, but Jonson hung his observations on a Latin grammatical framework. It also seems to be the first English grammar  book to quote the

Roman rhetorician Quintilian's dictum  "Custom  is the most certain mistress of language."

John  Wallis,  a  mathematician  and  member  of  the Royal Society, published in  1658 a grammar, written in Latin,  for  the  use  of  foreigners  who  wanted  to  learn English.  Wallis,  according  to  George  H.  McKnight, abandoned much of the method of Latin grammar. Wallis's grammar is perhaps best remembered  for being the source of the  much  discussed distinction  between shall and will. Wallis's grammar is also the one referred to by Samuel  Johnson in the front matter of his  1755 dictionary.

John Dryden deserves mention  too. He defended  the English of his time as an improvement  over the English of  Shakespeare and  Jonson.  He  is the  first  person  we know of who worried  about  the  preposition  at  the  end of a sentence. He eliminated  many such from  his own writings when revising his works for a collected edition. He  seems  to  have  decided  the  practice  was  wrong because it could not happen  in Latin.

C. C. Fries tells us that 17th-century grammars in general were designed either for foreigners or for school use, in  order  to  lead to  the  study  of Latin. In the  18th century,  however,  grammars were  written  predominantly for English speakers, and although they were written for the  purpose  of instructing, they  seem to find more  fun in correcting. A change in the underlying philosophy of grammar had  occurred,  and  it  is made explicit  in  perhaps the first 18th-century grammar, A Key to the Art of Letters . . . , published in  1700 by a schoolmaster named A. Lane. He thought  it a mistake to view grammar simply as a means to learn a foreign language and asserted that "the true End and Use of Grammar is to teach how to  speak  and  write  well  and  learnedly  in  a language already  known,  according to  the  unalterable  Rules of right Reason." Gone  was  Ben  Jonson's  appeal to custom.

There was evidently a considerable amount of general interest in things grammatical among men of letters, for Addison, Steele, and  Swift  all treated  grammar in  one way or another in The Tatler and The Spectator in  1710, 1711,  and  1712.  In  1712 Swift  published  yet  another proposal for an English academy (it came within a whisker of succeeding); John Oldmixon attacked Swift's proposal in the same year. Public interest must have helped create  a  market  for  the  grammar  books  which  began appearing with  some frequency  about  this  same  time. And  if  controversy  fuels  sales,  grammarians knew  it; they  were  perfectly willing  to emphasize  their  own advantages  by  denigrating  their predecessors,  sometimes in abusive terms.

We  need  mention  only  a  few  of  these  productions here. Pride of place must  go to  Bishop Robert  Lowth's A Short Introduction to English Grammar, 1762. Lowth's book is both brief and logical. Lowth was influenced by the theories of James Harris's Hermes, 1751, a curious  disquisition  about  universal grammar.  Lowth apparently  derived his notions about  the  perfectability of English grammar from  Harris, and he did not doubt that he could reduce the language to a system of uniform rules.  Lowth's  approach  was  strictly  prescriptive;  he meant  to improve and correct, not describe. He judged correctness  by  his  own  rules-mostly  derived from Latin  grammar-which  frequently  went against established  usage.  His favorite  mode  of illustration  is what was  known  as  "false  syntax":  examples  of linguistic wrongdoing  from  the  King James  Bible, Shakespeare, Sidney, Donne,  Milton, Swift, Addison,  Pope-the most  respected  names in  English  literature.  He  was so sure of himself that he could permit himself a little joke;

discussing the  construction  where  a preposition  comes at  the  end  of a clause or sentence, he  says, "This  is an idiom, which our language is strongly inclined to."

Lowth's grammar was not written for children. But he did what he intended  to so well that subsequent grammarians  fairly  fell  over  themselves  in  haste  to  get  out versions of Lowth suitable for school use, and most subsequent  grammars-including  Noah  Webster's firstwere to some extent based upon Lowth's.

The older descriptive tradition  of Jonson and Wallis was not  quite  dead,  however.  Joseph  Priestley's  grammar, first published  in  1761,  used  false  syntax too,  but in  the  main  Priestley was more  tolerant  of established usages that Lowth considered to be in error. In his later editions he politely but firmly disagreed with Lowth on specific  points.  Priestley's grammar enjoyed  some success and his opinions were treated  with respect,  but  he was not imitated  like Lowth.

The most successful  of  the Lowth  adapters  was Lindley  Murray.  Murray  was  an  American  living in England-Dennis Baron informs us that he had made a considerable  fortune  trading with  the  Loyalists during the  American  Revolution  and  had  moved  to England ostensibly  for  reasons of health.  Friends asked  him  to ' write a grammar for use in an English girls' school, and he obliged. Murray considered himself only a compiler, and that  he was. He  took  over  verbatim  large  patches from Lowth and teased them out with pieces taken from Priestley and a few other grammarians and rhetoricians. He removed  the  authors'  names from  the  false  syntax and  stirred  in  a  heavy  dose  of  piety.  He  silently and primly  corrected Lowth's  jocular  little  clause  to "to which our language is strongly inclined." The resulting mixture was one of the most successful grammar books ever, remaining a standard text in American schools for a  half century.

George Campbell's The Philosophy of Rhetoric, 1776, is not a grammar book proper, but it contains a long  discussion of grammatical proprieties. Campbell starts out sensibly  enough;  he  says  that  grammar  is  based  on usage, and he rejects notions of an abstract or universal grammar. But he then proceeds to examine usage, concluding that the usage that counts is reputable, national, and present  use. He goes on to present  nine canons of verbal  criticism,  by  one  or  another  of  which  he  can reject  any usage he chooses to.  By the  time all the discussions of barbarisms, solecisms, and improprieties are finished-the discussions are well supplied with examples  from  many  of  Bishop Lowth's  favorite  whipping boys-it is quite  apparent  that the  reputable,  national, and present  use that passes all tests is simply whatever suits the taste of George Campbell.

Books of grammar and rhetoric had existed in English from  the  16th  and  17th  centuries.  The  18th  century's new  contribution  was  the  book  of  unvarnished usage opinion,  best  exemplified by  Robert Baker's  anonymously published Reflections on the English Language, 1770. (Baker was apparently anticipated in this genre by Observations upon the English Language, 1752, another anonymous publication,  ascribed by Sterling A. Leonard  to  one George Harris.) We know  nothing of Baker except what he put  down  about  himself in his preface. He says that he left  school at fifteen, that he learned no Greek and only the easiest Latin, that he has never seen the  folio edition  of Johnson's Dictionary, and  that  he owns no books. He fancies he has good taste, however, and  he  clearly  understands  French.  His  book  is  patterned on Remarques sur la languefrançoise, 1659, written  by Claude Faure de Vaugelas, a leading member of the  French Academy.

Baker's Reflections is  a  random  collection  of  comments, mostly about  what he considers misuses, based chiefly on books that he has borrowed or read. He brings forward  no  authorities  to  support  his ipse  dixit pronouncements, many of which are on the order of "This is not good English" or "This does not make sense." Yet a  surprising number  of the  locutions he questioned are still to be found  as topics of discussion in current books on usage. It is less surprising, perhaps, that the moderns are still repeating Baker's conclusions.

The 19th century is so rich in usage lore that it is hard to summarize. We find something new in the  entrance of journalists into  the  usage field. Reviews had  commented  on  grammatical  matters  throughout  the  18th century, it is true, but  in the  19th newspapers and magazines with wider  popular  appeal  began to  pronounce. One result of this activity was the usage book that consists of pieces first written for a newspaper or magazine and then collected into a book along with selected comments and suggestions by readers (this type of book is still  common  today). Perhaps the first  of these  was A Plea for  the  Queen's English, 1864, by  Henry  Alford, dean of Canterbury.  Alford was vigorously attacked by George Washington Moon, a writer born  in London of American  parents,  in  a  work  that  eventually  became titled The Dean's English. The controversy fueled several  editions  of both  books  and  seems to  have  entertained readers on both sides of the Atlantic.

On  the  American  side  of  the  Atlantic  the  puristic strictures of Edward S. Gould, originally  newspaper and magazine contributions, were collected as Good English in  1867. Gould  was  apparently  annoyed  to  find  that Alford had  anticipated him  on  several  points,  and devoted  a section to belaboring the  Dean, only to discover that Moon had anticipated him there. He acknowledged  the  justness  of  Moon's  criticisms  and then appended  a few  parting shots at  Moon's  English, before tacking on an assault on the  spelling reforms of Noah Webster and a series of lectures on pulpit oratory. Moon replied with The Bad English  ofLindley  Murray and Other Writers  on the English Language, 1868, listed by H. L. Mencken as being in its eighth edition in  1882, under the title Bad English Exposed. (Gould was one of the  "other  writers.")  Language controversy sold books in America as well as in England.

The  most  popular  of  American  19th-century  commentators was Richard Grant White, whose Words  and Their  Uses, 1870, was  also  compiled  from  previously published articles. He did not  deign to  mention  earlier commentators  except to take a solitary whack at  Dean Alford for his sneer at  American  English. His chapters on "misused words" and "words that are not words" hit many of the same targets as Gould's chapters on "misused words" and "spurious words," but  White's  chapters are longer. Perhaps his most  entertaining sections deal with his denial that English has a grammar, which is introduced  by a  Dickensian account  of having been rapped  over the  knuckles at age five and a half for  not understanding his grammar lesson. White, who was not without intellectual attainments-he had edited Shakespeare-was nevertheless given to  frequent  faulty  etymologizing, and for some reason he was so upset by the progressive  passive is  being  built that  he  devoted  a whole chapter  to excoriating it. These last two  features caught the attention  of the peppery  Fitzedward Hall, an American teacher of Sanskrit living in England.

Hall  produced  a  whole  bookRecent  Exemplifications of False Philology, 1872-exposing White's errors, and returned to the attack again with Modern English in 1873. Hall was a new breed of commentator,  bringing a wealth  of  illustrative  material  from his  collection  of examples to  bear on  the  various points  of  contention. Hall's evidence should have been more than enough to overwhelm  White's  unsupported  assertions, but  it was not.  Partly to blame is the public's disdain of the scholarly, and partly to blame is Hall's style-he never makes a  point succinctly, but  lets his most trenchant  observations dissipate  in a cloud of sesquipedalian  afterthoughts. White's books, Mencken tells us, remained in print  until the 1930s;  Hall's  collection  of  examples became part of the  foundations  of the Oxford  English Dictionary.

Two  other 19th-century  innovations  deserve  mention. William  Cullen  Bryant's Index Expurgatorius, 1877,  is the  start  of the  American  newspaper  tradition in  usage-works written by newspaper  editors. Bryant was editor-in-chief and part owner of the New York  Evening Post. His Index is simply a list of words not to be used in the Post; there was no explanatory matter. Lists of forbidden  words were popular  for a time  afterward, but  the  fashion passed. The  newspaper  editor  as usage arbiter has  continued to the present, however.  The pseudonymous  Alfred  Ayres  in The  Verbalist, 1881, seems to have been the first, or one of the first, of these to arrange his comments in alphabetical order, creating a  sort of dictionary of usage.

In the early decades of the Republic, many Americans patriotically  supported  the  home-grown  version of the language against the language  of the vanquished British oppressors. There were proposals for a Federal English-Noah  Webster  was  in  the  forefront of  the movement-and for the establishment of an American academy to  promote and  regulate the  language-John Adams made one such proposal.

The  British, for  their  part,  were  not  amused  by  the presumption of  former  colonials. Americanisms  had been viewed askance as early as 1735, but the frequency and the ferocity of denunciation  markedly increased in the  19th century, as British travelers, some of them literary folk like Captain  Marryat, Mrs. Frances Trollope, and  Charles  Dickens,  visited  the  United States  and returned  to  England to  publish  books  of their  travels, almost always disparaging in tone.  They seldom failed to work in a few criticisms of the language  as well as the uncouth  character  and  manners  of Americans. British reviewers, too, were outspoken  in their denunciation of things American, and especially  Americanisms.

American writers put up a spirited defense for a time, but  the  writing  class  eventually  began  to  wear  down under  the  onslaught. By  1860,  in  an  article  crying up Joseph  Worcester's  dictionary,  the Atlantic  Monthly could call American  English "provincial." The general attitude after  the  Civil War  seems to have been  one of diffidence  rather than  defiance. The diffident  attitude is of interest  here because it was in the  second half of the 19th  century  that  Americanisms  began  to  make  their way silently into American usage books as errors. Many of  these,  such  as balance for remainder and loan for lend, are still denigrated by American usage writers and their native origin passed over in silence.

We have said nothing about  19th-century grammars, and  not  much  needs  to  be  said  about  them.  If  those grammars were computers, the most successful could be called  clones of Lindley Murray.  Some dissatisfaction with the  older  English  traditions  existed,  especially in the first half of the  19th century in this country, but  little seems to have resulted from  it.  Books with innovative systems  met  with  little  success. Goold  Brown,  in  his Grammar of  English Grammars, first published in  1851, collected most of the grammars published up to his own

## 10a

time, and used them for his examples of false grammar. He also exhibited at length their inconsistencies and disagreements.  Goold  Brown permitted  himself one  mild observation  (most  were  rather  tart):  "Grammarians would perhaps differ less, if they read more."

By the end of the  19th century, differences  had developed between  the ways usage issues were being treated in  England  and  in  the  United  States.  Except  for  the fruits of the Alford-Moon controversy, there seem to be very few British books concerned exclusively with usage problems.  The  most  frequently  reprinted of  these  few was one written by a Scot: William B. Hodgson's Errors in the Use of  English, 1881. British literati were not indifferent to such issues, but they seem  mainly to have put their comments  in  reviews  and letters and  works directed primarily to other subjects. Walter Savage Landor, for instance, delivered himself of a number of idiosyncratic views about language and usage in one or two of his Imaginary Conversations. John Stuart Mill put a few of his opinions into A System of  Logic.

America, on the other hand, saw the growth of a small industry devoted to the cultivation of the linguistically insecure, who were being produced  in increasing numbers by American public schools  using the grammar of Lindley Murray combined with the opinions of Richard Grant White.  After the  Civil  War little  handbooks  for the guidance of the  perplexed  appeared with  some frequency. We have mentioned one of these, Alfred Ayres's The Verbalist. Others bear such titles as Vulgarisms and Other  Errors of Speech,  Words:  Their Use and  Abuse, Some Common Errors of Speech, and Slips of Tongue and  Pen. The production of popular books on usage topics continues to be common  in the 20th-century United States.

The  different  approaches  of  the  British and  Americans to usage questions  have continued  along the  lines evident in the last half of the  19th century. Fewer books devoted to usage issues have been produced in England, and the arena there has been dominated by two names: Fowler and Gowers. H. W. Fowler's best-known work is Modern English Usage, 1926, an  expanded,  updated, and alphabetized  version of The King's  English, which he had produced with one of his brothers in  1906. This book gained ready acceptance as an authority, and it is usually  treated  with  considerable  deference  on both sides  of  the  Atlantic.  It is a  thick  book  in  small print, packed  with  a  combination  of  good  sense,  traditional attitudes,  pretension-pricking, minute distinctions, and a good deal of what Otto Jespersen, the Danish scholarly grammarian  of  the  English  language,  called  "language moralizing."  Fowler,  in  the  tradition  of  Alford  and Richard  Grant  White,  found  much  to  dislike  in  the prose  of  contemporary  newspapers.  He  had  no  gadfly like George  Washington  Moon  to challenge his authority,  although  he  did  dispute  a  few  constructions  with Otto Jespersen in the  pages of the  tracts issued  by the Society  for  Pure  English.  In  some  of  these  disputes  a characteristic pattern emerges: the  historical grammarian finds a construction in  literature and wonders  how it came to be; Fowler finds the same construction in the newspapers and condemns it.

Sir Ernest Gowers came into usage commentary from a different  direction: he was asked to prepare a book for British  civil  servants  to  help  them  avoid  the  usual bureaucratic jargon of  British officiai  prose. The result was Plain  Words, 1941. This  slender  book  has  gone through  several  editions,  growing  a  bit  each  time.  In 1965 a new edition of Fowler appeared, edited by Gowers, to which Gowers added a number of his own favorite topics.  In addition  to  Fowler and Gowers, the work of Eric Partridge, particularly Usage and Abusage, 1942, has been influential.

In recent years, while some English books about usage have concerned themselves with traditional questions of propriety,  others  have  taken  a different  path, explaining  the  peculiarities  of  English  idiom to  learners  of English.

The  treatment  of  usage  in  20th-century  America, however,  hews steadfastly  to the traditional line of linguistic etiquette. School grammars  are  elaborately graded and decked out with color printing, but the most successful  are still solidly based on  Lowth and Murray. College  handbooks  have  proliferated  since 1917, the date  of the  earliest one  in our collection.  The  contents of these  works have  not  changed  greatly, however; the essential sameness of the "Glossaries of Usage" attached to them suggests that their contents are to some extent determined by a desire to carry over from the previous edition as much as possible and to cover what the competition  covers.  General-purpose  guides  for  those whose schooling is complete are still produced  regularly, and  in  a wider variety of  shapes and  sizes  than  in  the 19th  century.  These  have  developed offshoots in  the form  of  books  aimed  at  business  writers  and  others aimed at technical and scientific writers.

The  newspaper  tradition  has also  continued  strong. Some usage questions are dealt with in house stylebooks (now  often  published  for outsiders, as well), and newspaper editors have written usage guides for the general public,  though  these  usually  have  a  strong  newspaper slant. Especially prominent among these are the several books  of Theodore  Bernstein, particularly The Careful Writer, 1965.

A  characteristic of  writing on  usage  has  been,  right from the beginning, disagreement among the writers on specific points. Various attempts at reconciling these differences have been made, especially in the 20th century. One  of the  earliest dates  from  1883. C.  W.  Bardeen, a schoolbook  publisher, put out a little book  in which he tried to discover a consensus  by examining some thirty sources,  including  a  number  of  current  usage  books, some  grammars,  some  works  on  philology,  some  on synonymy, and Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries. Roy Copperud has produced books on the same general plan in  1970 and 1980.

Another approach to the problem of varying opinion has  been  the  survey  of  opinion.  Sterling  A.  Leonard made the first in  1931.  Leonard's survey was replicated in  1971 by Raymond D. Crisp, and a similar survey was conducted  in  England by G.  H.  Mittins and three colleagues and published in  1970. The results of these surveys are quantified,  so  that  interested  readers can discover the relative acceptability or obloquy of each tested item. Somewhat the same idea has also been tried with the usage panel, an assembled panel of experts to whom each  individual  item  is submitted  for approval or disapproval.  Again,  quantification  of relative approval or disapproval is the aim.

The 20th century is the first in which usage has been studied  from  a  scholarly  or  historical  point  of  view, although  Fitzedward  Hall's Modern English of  1873 should probably  be acknowledged as a  precursor. Thomas R. Lounsbury collected a number of his magazine  articles  into The Standard of  Usage in English, 1908, which examined  the background of attitudes and issues.  J.  Lesslie  Hall's English Usage, 1917, checked 141 issues drawn from the work of Richard Grant White and from  several college-level  grammars and rhetorics against evidence  from English and American literature. Sterling  A.  Leonard  in The Doctrine of Correctness  in

English  Usage 1700-1800, 1929, provided the first thorough examination of the origins of many attitudes about usage in the  18th century.

Looking back from  the  late  1980s we  find  that  the 1920s and  1930s were a time of considerable interest in the  examination  and  testing  of  attitudes  and  beliefs about usage and in a rationalization of the  matter and methods of school grammar. Various publications written by Charles C. Fries and Robert C. Pooley, for example, seemed to point the way. They had relatively little influence in the following decades, however; the schoolbooks by and large follow  the traditional lines, and the popular books of usage treat the traditional subjects. A notable exception is Bergen and Cornelia Evans's A Dictionary of  Contemporary American Usage, 1957. The book takes the traditional view of many specific issues, but it is strong in  insisting that actual  usage, both historical and contemporary, must be weighed carefully in reaching usage opinions.

If the  mainstream of usage commentary has continued to run in the  same old channels, there have  nonetheless been some undercurrents of importance. Serious examination of the received truths has continued. Margaret M. Bryant's Current  American  Usage, 1962, reported the results of the testing of many specific items against actual use as shown in current  books, magazines, and newspapers. Articles in  scholarly books  and journals (like American  Speech) evince  continuing  interest in real language and real usage in spite of a strong ten- dency  in  modern  linguistics  toward  the  study  of  language in more abstract  ways. If the popular idea of usage is  represented  by  the  continuing  series  of  books  produced  by  the  journalists Philip  Howard  (in  England) and  William  Safire (in  the  United  States)  and  by  the continuing  publication  of  traditionally oriented  handbooks,  there  is  also  some  countervailing critical  opinion, as shown by such books as Dwight Bolinger's Language -the Loaded  Weapon, Jim  Quinn's American Tongue and Cheek, Dennis Baron's Grammar and Good Taste, and  Harvey  Daniels's Famous Last  Words, all published in the early 1980s.

A  historical  sketch  of  this  length  necessarily  must omit  many  deserving  names  and  titles  and  pass  over many interesting observers and  observations. This we regret, but do not apologize for, as the need to omit what we would  prefer to  include  seems  almost  omnipresent in  our work as  lexicographers. Much  of  the historical information herein draws heavily on materials  available in Leonard's Doctrine of Correctness; Charles Carpenter Fries's The  Teaching of  the  English Language, 1927'; George H. McKnight's Modern  English in the  Making, 1928;  H.  L.  Mencken's The American Language, 4th edition,  1936, and Supplement  1, 1945;  Baron's Grammar and Good  Taste, 1982; and Daniels's Famous Last Words, 1983. These  books  constitute  a  rich  mine  of information for the serious student of English usage and its  history,  to  whom  we  also  recommend  a perusal  of our bibliography.

a, an There is an article on the proper use of a and an in  almost  every  usage  book ever  written,  although hardly a native speaker of English has any difficulty with them-in fact  one seldom thinks  about  them at  all in speech.

ing  the  clipped  forms  as barbarisms, but  commenting that he thought  the practice had fallen into general disgrace because of the attacks  of the  satirists and  that  it never showed itself in books.

The  difficulty,  when  there  is any, is to  be  found  in writing. The basic rules are these: use a before a consonant sound; use an before a vowel sound. Before a letter or  an  acronym  or  before  numerals,  choose a or an according  to  the  way  the  letter  or  numeral is  pronounced: an FDA directive, a U.N. resolution, a $5.00 bill.

Actual  usage,  of  course,  is  more  complex  than  the simple  rules  would  lead  you  to  expect.  Here  is  what actual usage shows:

- 1. Before words with an initial consonant sound, a is usual in speech and writing. This is in line with the basic rule.
- 2.  Before h in an unstressed or weakly stressed syllable, a and an are  both  used  in  writing (an historic, a historic) but an is more usual in speech, whether  the h is pronounced  or not. This variation is the result of historical development;  in unstressed and weakly stressed syllables, h was  formerly  not  pronounced in many words where it is pronounced at the present time. A few words, such as historic and (especially in England) hotel, are in transition, and may be found with either a or an. You choose the article that suits your own pronunciation.
- 3.  Occasionally in  modern  writing  and  speech  and regularly in the  King James Version of the  Bible, an is used before h in  a  stressed  syllable, as in an hundred. Again, we have the same historical change: many more words were pronounced with a silent initial h in the past than are at present. A few words, such as heir, hour, and honest, generally have silent initial h; some others, like herb or humble are pronounced both ways. Use a or an according to your own  pronunciation.
- 4.  Before words  beginning with  a  consonant  sound but  an  orthographic  vowel, an is  sometimes  used  in speech and writing (an unique,  such an one). This use is less frequent  now than in the  past.
- 5.  Before words  with  an  initial  vowel  sound, an is usual in speech and writing. This is in line with the basic rule.
- 6. Occasionally,  and more often  in some dialects than others, a is used in speech before words beginning with a  vowel  sound.  The  Dictionary  of American Regional English reports this to be frequent  in the United States; the evidence suggests it may have been somewhat  more common in the past.
- 7. A is  normally  unstressed,  and  pronounced \ a \ . When stressed, as in "He's a vice president, not the vice president," it is pronounced  \ ' â \  in the  United  States, but often  \ ' a \  in Canada.

abbreviations Abbreviations have been receiving bad notices since the  18th century. Such writers as Addison and  Swift  satirized the  fashionable practice  of  the time of  using  truncated or clipped forms of  long words-such as pozz,  phizz, plenipo, and hippo for positively, physiognomy,  plenipotentiary, and hypochondria -in conversation.  Ordinary  contractionscan't, haven't, shan't,  isn't, for  instance-were  likewise satirized. Campbell  1776 took  notice of the  practice, class-

Perhaps Dr. Campbell  was premature  in announcing the  abandonment  of  the  practice  of  abbreviating,  for usage books down to the present day wag their fingers at the practice. MacCracken &amp; Sandison 1917,  for instance, lists several truncations disapprovinglyamong them auto, phone,  photo,  exam, and gym. Guth 1985  continues  the  critical  tradition  but  changes  the truncations:

Avoid informal abbreviations. Avoid clipped  forms like bike, prof, doc,  fan  mag, exec, econ. (Other shortened forms, like phone,  ad, and exam are now commonly used in serious writing.)

Aside from  the  social acceptability  of clipped  forms (Emily  Post  in  1927 disapproved phone and photo), there are other considerations to be taken into  account. Handbooks  in general recommend  avoiding abbreviations in "formal" writing. Flesch 1964  disagrees, however:

It's  a  superstition  that  abbreviations  shouldn't  be used  in  serious writing  and  that  it's  good  style  to spell  everything  out.  Nonsense:  use  abbreviations whenever  they  are customary  and won't attract  the attention  of the reader.

Flesch's advice seems sound; but  care should be  taken to observe what  in fact  is customary. It is obvious that what  is customary in technical writing will be  different from  what  is customary  in journalism  or  in scholarly articles.  If  you  are  uncertain,  you  should  consult  an appropriate  style manual or handbook.  General advice can be found  in any of a number  of composition  handbooks and  in general style manuals, such  as Webster's Standard American Style Manual.

abdomen This  word  may  be  pronounced  with  the main stress on the first syllable or on the  second: Vabda-manN or Xab-'dô-manV The former version predominates  among  laypeople;  physicians  are  more  evenly divided.

abhorrence Bernstein  1965  notes  that abhorrence, when followed by a preposition, takes of. This is true in a  large majority  of cases.

. . .  my natural abhorrence of its sickening inhumanity  -George  Bernard  Shaw, Back  to  Methuselah, 1921

The word has also been used with a few other  prepositions, however, such as to (an instance of which was corrected  to of by Lindley Murray  in  1795), against, and for. These are less frequent  by far, and are in the  main to be found  in older literature.

. . . my  unbounded  abhorrence  for  this  miserable wretch  -P.  B. Shelley, quoted  by Matthew  Arnold, Essays  in Criticism, Second Series, 1888

abhorrent When used with a preposition, abhorrent is  almost always followed by to:

. . . words like "unfair" whose very sound is abhorrent to him -Joseph Conrad, Chance, 1913

abide 1. The  original  principal  parts  of abide are abode, past,  and abidden, past  participle.  The  OED notes that in time the past and past participle coalesced in abode, and abidden fell  into  disuse, although  a  few 19th-century writers tried  to revive it.  During the  19th century  a regular past and  past  participle abided came into use. It is more likely to be used now than abode is. Abode, while not very much  used by modern writers, is kept alive by its use in  such familiar literary works as "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," and in works referring to  an  earlier era,  as Samuel  Hopkins  Adams's Grandfather  Stories (1955).

2. Except for can't abide and abide by, which are in continuing vigorous use, most senses of abide have a rather literary or old-fashioned flavor. They do, however, continue in reputable,  if somewhat  infrequent,  use.

3. Evans 1957 comments that can't abide is "commonly disparaged."  One  source  of the  disparagement  is Partridge  1942,  who  calls  the  expression  "a  low-class colloquialism"-he  does  allow  that  in  American  use  it might  be  "homely  or  half-humorous,"  an  opinion  he may have derived  from  Krapp  1927,  who  commented on the expression's "somewhat  archaic and rustic character."  Evans defends can't  abide as having force  and flavor. Indeed it is hard to  see what  the  objection was. The  expression  goes back  to  the  16th  century; Shakespeare uses it several times in his plays:

She  could  not  abide Master Shallow 2  Henry  IV, 1598

It  is true  that  Shakespeare puts it  into  the  mouths  of commoners-those who speak prose rather  than  blank verse. Modern evidence, however, shows that the usage is  perfectly  proper:

. . . which  may  have  been  intended  to  prove  how open-minded  and aesthetically susceptible Canaday is  even  to  work  he  cannot  abide  -Harold  Rosenburg, New Yorker, 1  Jan.  1972

This  sense of abide is usually used  in  a  negative construction  or in one with negative implications:

My  inability when  I was young to abide most males of  my own age disguised loneliness that no  amount of  variety assuaged  -Donald Hall, N. Y. Times  Book Rev., 16 Jan. 1983

abject Nickles  1974 and  Safire (N.Y.  Times,  2 Sept. 1984) call the  phrase abject poverty a  clichØ.  Our  evidence  shows that abject is  frequently  used  to  modify poverty; in  this  use abject is  not  much  more  than  an intensifier:

. . . the  Place Maubert,  still at  the  end  of the  nineteenth century the area of the most abject poverty Times Literary Supp., 14 Nov. 1968

Our earliest evidence for the phrase, however, does not refer to economic circumstances:

. . . while they  profess to build  upon  Naturalism  an edifying  and  attractive  philosophy  of life,  they disguise from themselves and others the bare and abject poverty of the scheme -W. R. Inge, The Church in the World, 1928

Nickles strikes further  at abject by claiming it  "tends to  generate  clichØs  in  clusters,  vitiating  any  noun  it accompanies."  This  is  a  patent  overstatement. Abject connotes  two  kinds of low degree: one of low circumstances-abasement-and one of servility or spinelessness-debasement. It can be applied directly to persons:

Farmers who  have to  work  16 hours  a day to  pay rent and interest on mortgages in addition to buying necessities  for  their  families  are  not  free:  they  are abject  slaves -George Bernard Shaw, New Republic, 22 Nov. 1954

. . . the time  would  come  that  no  human  being should be humiliated or be made abject -Katherine Anne Porter, The Never-Ending Wrong, 1977

. . . Bloom  beholds  himself,  in  a  hideous  vision, looking  on  at  Blazes  Boylan  and  Molly, an  abject cuckold -Edmund Wilson, Axel's Castle, 1931

He was abject before Wolf Larsen and almost grovelled  to  Johansen  -Jack  London, The Sea-Wolf, 1904

. . . a sinner, and a repentant  prostrate  abject  sinner -George Meredith, The Ordeal of Richard Feverel, 1859

More often  it is applied to the actions and conditions of  such persons:

. . . my critical intelligence sometimes shrivels to an abject  nodding  of  the  head  -Lewis  H.  Lapham, Harper's, May  1971

. . . the aversion my person inspired even in its most abject  and  obsequious  attitudes  -Samuel  Beckett, Evergreen, June 1967

The possibility of humiliation  . . . touched  a vein of abject  cowardice in his composition  -H. G. Wells, Joan and Peter, 1 9 1 8

Then,  what  submission, what cringing and fawning, what  servility,  what  abject  humiliation  -Charles Dickens, A Tale  of Two  Cities, 1859

. . . when  the  least sickness attacked  her,  under  the most abject depression and terror of death  -W. M. Thackeray, Vanity  Fair, 1848

The sensation of nameless terror and abject fear  . . . overmastered  me  completely  -Rudyard  Kipling, "The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes," 1888

. . . having dictated  to  our  enemies  the  terms  of a most  abject  surrender  -Archibald  MacLeish, Saturday Rev., 9 Feb. 1946

. . . without fear, but with the most abject awe of the aristocracy -T. S. Eliot, "Philip  Massinger," Selected  Essays, 1932

Conway survived and penned  an abject  apology to Washington  American  Guide Series:  Maryland, 1940

These examples are typical uses of abject. The most frequently  modified  nouns, after poverty, are fear,  terror, surrender, and apology. It seems unlikely that any of the writers cited considered abject to have a vitiating effect.

abjure,  adjure A number  of commentators  (such as Harper  1985, Shaw  1975, Bremner  1980, the  Oxford American Dictionary 1980,  Bernstein 1965,  Evans 1957)  warn that these words are confused with some frequency. Evidence of such confusion  is not  to be  found in  the Merriam-Webster files; if it does exist, it is apparently corrected in manuscript. Abjure means "to renounce, reject,  avoid"; adjure "to  urge or advise earnestly."  Besides  differing  in  meaning,  the  two  words take  different  grammatical constructions. Abjure regularly takes a  noun  as direct  object.  The  noun  often  is, but need not be, abstract; it is rarely a personal noun.

Galileo  was  summoned  before  the  Inquisition  at Rome, and there he was made to abjure the  Copernican theory  -S.  F. Mason, Main Currents of  Scientific  Thought, 1953

Just one whiff of that vast butchery  . . .  is enough  to make  a  sensitive person  abjure  meat  forever  -Ian Fleming, Thrilling  Cities, 1963

Adjure, on  the  other  hand,  typically  takes  a  personal noun or pronoun  followed by to and an infinitive:

The  wives  and  daughters  of  the  Germans  rushed about  the  camp  . . .  adjuring  their  countrymen to save them from slavery -J. A. Froude, Caesar, 1879

There  is no use adjuring them to take  part in it  or warning them to keep out  of it -Malcolm Cowley, Exile's Return, 1934

Adjure, incidentally, is used quite  a bit  less  frequently than abjure.

## ablative See  INCOMPARABLE.

able to In constructions where able is followed  by to and the  infinitive, the  infinitive  is nearly always in  the active voice, whether  the  subject  is human  or  nonhuman. Human  subjects are more  common:

. . . people have traditionally been able to walk into museums  free  -Huntington  Hartford, The Public Be Damned, 1955

So  far, I have been able to keep my enthusiasm  . . . under control  -John Fischer, Harper's, November 1970

But the  City  that  lay between  was not  his ground, and Richard II was no more able than  Charles I to dictate  to  its  militia  -G.  M.  Trevelyan, English Social  History, 1942

She  hopes to find Somebody able and willing to buy her  freedom  -Lafcadio  Hearn, Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan, 1894

There are those from whom not even death has been able to disconnect me -George P. Elliott, Harper's, September 1970

The passive infinitive is much less common. Some commentators (Longman 1984, Perrin &amp; Ebbitt  1972) opine that the construction  sounds awkward; perhaps it  often does, and awkwardness may account for its being fairly uncommon.  Here are three examples to show that it is used on occasion:

. . . Mr.  Doddington,  from  whose  disapproval  the story of Gavin and the  Concannons' party  had  not been  able  to  be  kept  -Elizabeth  Bowen, Horizon, September 1945

. . . so social and  religious life would  be  able to  be carried out on a normal basis -L. S. B.  Leakey, Mau Mau and the Kikuyu, 1952

. . . a  simple  experiment  able  to  be  performed  by anyone Monsanto Mag., December 1953

Using the last example for illustrative purposes, we can avoid the passive infinitive by revising it to include can or could:

. . . a  simple  experiment that  anyone  could  (can) perform;

or

. . . a  simple  experiment  that  can  (could)  be  performed by anyone.

abortive A love of etymology and the consequent dismembering of English words into their  presumed  constituent parts has led many a usage commentator  down the primrose path of error (see ETYMOLOGICAL FALLACY). Safire  1982 seconds a correspondent's  objection  to  the use  of abortive to  describe  a  failed  mission  to  rescue U.S.  hostages in Iran in  1979. Safire claims to see in the suffix -ive an  implication  of  continuation or  permanence,  and  he  maintains  that abortive must therefore "suggest a continuous  process of aborting." This is, of course,  a  conclusion  that  could  only  be  reached  by ignoring the  use of the  whole word  in English  in favor of  speculating about  what  it might mean. No  "continuous process of aborting" is suggested by Shakespeare's line

Why  should  I joy  in  any  abortive  birth?  Love's Labour's  Lost, 1595

Safire further  asserts that "'abortive efforts' should be used only when the emphasis is on a series of past  failures."  In  actuality  the  word  is often  used  to  modify  a plural noun, but  emphasis on past failures may or may not be present:

. . . a  magazine  existed,-after  so  many  abortive attempts  -Van  Wyck  Brooks, The  Flowering  of New England, 1815-1865, rev. Ød., 1946

. . . and  forget  that  abortive  efforts  from  want  of heart  are as possible to  revenge as to generosity Thomas Hardy, The  Mayor  of Casterbridge, 1886

He knew it was like feeling over a chilling motor  for loose wires, and after  two or three abortive  motions he gave it up -Wallace Stegner, "The Traveler," in Perspectives  USA, Summer 1953

Moreover,  many  a  writer  from  Shakespeare  to  the present  has used the  word  of a single incident  with no hint  of recurrence or permanence:

The power that had proved too strong for this abortive restoration  -Arnold J. Toynbee, Center Mag., March 1968

After  the  abortive  Decembrist  insurrection  in  1825 -George F. Kennan, New Yorker, 1 May 1971
